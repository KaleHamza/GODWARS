Our game has its first NPC here, and its sole purpose is to either sell or buy something.(10/04/2023)

We have a new Inventory DataSave system, but it's just on the code side, so I cannot show you a picture. When you kill a monster, some items from the inventory may drop from the enemy.(12.04.2023)


We have a player panel, and we can equip items on ourselves.The items we equip provide us with various enhancements.(13.04.2023)

Finally, the game can have a storyline! With this new feature, we don't just want to defeat monsters, we want to do it because they are terrorizing the village!!!
Emotions are everything...
